    "## Project Introduction\n",
    "Like any other science, programming for weightlifting follows specific rules and utilizes studied equations and ratios to optimize progression in strength or hypertrophy. Unfortunately, due to the wide range of potential body types, optimal programming differs greatly from person to person, making most cookie cutter programs sub-optimal for growth. As a result, there is a huge market for fitness experts to sell their knowledge in weightlifting programming, with the fitness industry itself being valued at upwards of $4.6bn as of 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "That being said, this is my attempt on creating an algorithm that can personalize a powerlifting protocol (Sheiko) to your needs. While this simple Jupyter notebook will by no means be a disruptor to the programming industry, I think it's a nifty tool to help you program based off of the research and experience of renowned Russian powerlifting coach Boris Sheiko.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Current Features\n",
    "- IPF Weight Class Calculator\n",
    "- Lifter Classification Calculator based off of Sheiko's classification chart\n",
    "- Load Classification based off of Sheiko's subjective experience\n",
    "- Summary function to display user stats\n",
    "- Beginner Program Generator and Render Function\n",
    "\n",
    "### Planned Features\n",
    "- Better implementation of Program Generator (less statically typed elements)\n",
    "- Intermediate Program Generator\n",
    "- Advanced Program Generator\n",
    "- Options between hypertrophy and strength focus\n",
    "- Prep vs. Competition Program Cycles\n",
    "- PDF and LaTex Implementation"
